# Maze (Epitech Dante)

This project builds a maze and solves it!

It was made in C, and after the project I added a ncurses implementation (loop) that automatically generates and solves a maze, showing the whole process. Because it's actually quite enjoyable to watch.

I only worked on the generator part, my friend Sol√®ne Lefeu built the solver.
